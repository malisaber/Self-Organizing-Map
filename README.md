# Self-Organizing Map Project

This repository is a cleaned-up SOM course project with a more standard layout and a script-first entry point.

It includes:

- a Python script version of the notebook workflow,
- the original notebook for interactive exploration,
- MATLAB demos for competitive learning and SOM-style clustering,
- a LaTeX report with the generated figures and tables from the project write-up.

## What The Project Does

The project focuses on self-organizing maps and related neural methods:

- SOM clustering on the handwritten digits dataset,
- SOM-based digit classification using neuron labels from majority voting,
- a from-scratch single-hidden-layer classifier for Titanic survival prediction,
- MATLAB visualizations of competitive learning behavior.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- MATLAB R2019b+ for the demo scripts
- A LaTeX distribution if you want to rebuild the report

Install the Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How To Run

### Python script

Run the non-interactive script version of the notebook:

```bash
make script
```

or directly:

```bash
python src/python/som_project.py
```

### Notebook

Open the notebook for interactive exploration:

```bash
make notebook
```

The notebook expects to be launched from the repository root so it can read `data/titanic.csv`.

### MATLAB demos

From MATLAB, run:

```matlab
run('src/matlab/Competetive.m')
run('src/matlab/Cluster.m')
```

The demos save their GIFs under `outputs/animations/`.

### Report

Build the LaTeX report with:

```bash
make report
```

The source lives in `docs/report/Report.tex`.

## Notes

- The Python script writes plots into `outputs/figures/`.
- The report assets live in `docs/report/` so the LaTeX source and images stay together.
- `Makefile` includes helper targets for the notebook, script, report, and cleanup tasks.
